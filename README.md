## About this template
This is a reference Domino Project adapted from the Kaggle dataset and notebook found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/leomauro/anomaly-detection-streaming-data/input).<br>
This notebook presents a few unsupervised algorithms to detect anomaly in CPU Utilization streaming data.<br>
We are going to experiment Anomaly Detection in [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab).

## Prerequisities

### Environment
This template works on any standard Domino Environment, no GPUs are required. The necessary libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Workspace Tools
The only tool required is Jupyter Notebooks/Lab
